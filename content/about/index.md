I’m a Lead Machine Learning Engineer at LevelAI, with four years of hands-on experience in NLP, LLMs, and GenAI. My journey into AI wasn’t conventional—I don’t have a formal degree in AI or Computer Science. Instead, I’ve taught myself everything, from the depths of machine learning to its broadest applications.
<br><br>
To build a strong foundation, I’ve taken rigorous courses like :<br>

5)<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU"> CS229 on Machine Learning by Andrew Ng.</a><br>
I’m currently exploring reinforcement learning through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_iWQOsE6TfVYGEGiAOMaOzzv41Jfm_Ps"> Berkeley’s Deep RL course </a>
<br><br>
I stay at the forefront of the field by keeping up with the latest research, from Flash Attention and ROPE to RLHF and the pioneering work by OpenAI. On the applied side, I’ve brought theory to life—implementing models from scratch, writing extensive PyTorch and Python code, and turning research papers into real-world solutions.
<br><br>
As a Lead Machine Learning Engineer at LevelAI, I spearhead innovative projects that leverage advanced AI and NLP techniques to transform and enhance customer service experiences. My role involves developing, fine-tuning, and implementing models that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of contact center operations. Here are some of the key projects and contributions I've made at LevelAI:<br>
1. LLM Based Autoscoring of Contact Center Agents <br>
2. Contextual Emotion Detection in Dialogue Systems <br>
3. RAG based Chatbot for solving complex customer queries and helping contact center agents serve their customer better <br>
4. Automatic Customer Satisfaction and Customer effort detection from contact center conversations <br>
<br>
<b>Patents and Innovations</b><br>
Patent Granted in US Patent Agency for Development of a dynamic intent detection system detecting intents from customer-agent interaction in real time . This system is adaptable to real-time client modifications, surpassing traditional static models.

- This was part of our gold Winning solution for Kaggle Comeptition on Detection of Gravitational Waves <br>
- We built an end-to-end 1D Convolutional Neural Network architecture that can be applied directly on raw
time-series data collected by these interferometers to detect gravitational waves. The key model aspects are ability to capture hierarchical features using parallel Convolutional blocks and residual learning via custom Residual layers.
